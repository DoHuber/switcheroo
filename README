This is Switcheroo, a modern take on the classic phrase drawing game. Simply clone & build the source code and 
distribute among as many devices as you want. Then just have one device hosting the game, the others can join
conveniently via QR code. 

Players then take turns in drawing and describing pictures; in the end everyone can download and/or share
a compilation of the full game.

There are no special setup procedures, simply building the APK should be enough to play Switcheroo
with friends and the like. The code is organized as a standard Android project.

The authors (group 10) of this project are:

Ignored warnings:
Some Linter warnings are ignored on purpose. In most cases, this will be documented directly in
the code with regular line (//) comments. Some could not be explained via comments and will be
elaborated upon here:

- FrameLayout can be replaced with merge tag: This happens in both activites, this is in fact a
false statement, as doing that would lead to the Fragment functionality powering this app breaking
down, as the merge tag cannot have an ID.

- Buttons should be borderless: The team's designer decided that this looks better, so this
warning is just ignored.

- Found bitmap drawable.. : Ignored, because the file does indeed not scale, but is used in a
fixed-size context, so different sizes are not needed.
