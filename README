This is Switcheroo, a modern take on the classic phrase drawing game. Simply clone & build the source code and 
distribute among as many devices as you want. Then just have one device hosting the game, the others can join
conveniently via QR code. 

Players then take turns in drawing and describing pictures; in the end everyone can download and/or share
a compilation of the full game.

There are no special setup procedures, simply building the APK should be enough to play Switcheroo
with friends and the like. The code is organized as a standard Android project.
